1. Adding the aos layer to your build
=====================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the aos layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the aos layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-aos \
    "


2. Misc
=======

Set GO_LINKSHARED = "" in your image configuration in order to disable shared
link for go packages. As go plugins doesn't work with shared link.
